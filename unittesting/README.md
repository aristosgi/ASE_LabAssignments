## <a name="arithmetic-operations"></a>Arithmetic Operations

This class contains methods for multiplying and dividing numbers. 
The objective of the lab assignment was to provide test cases for each one of the methods.

* The `divide` method is tested to throw an `ArithmeticException` whenever a division by zero is attempted.
* The `multiply` method is tested to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` whenever a negative number is used as an input.

## <a name="my-math"></a>MyMath

MyMath is a new class that was created for the purposes of this assignment.
The method's objective is to calculate the factorial of any given number in the range of [0, 12].

The class only contains a `factorial` method, which is tested using a Testing Suite.

* `MyMathParametrizedTest` class contains the parameterized test of boundary and valid input values.
* `MyMathTest` class contains tests regarding out-of-range values that should raise exceptions.
